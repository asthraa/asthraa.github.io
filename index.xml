      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer who enjoys mostly working on backend &amp;amp; infrastructure. I really believe that software engineering is an art of problem solving. So I am not confined to one language or framework. Throughout my career, I have worked on multiple projects in Ruby/Rails, Python/Flask, PHP, Visual Basic. One thing I have realised by being a sofware engineer is that learning is a journey. I always experiment with new techonologies &amp;amp; frameworks by building some mini projects.</description>
